 Former Software Engineer @TCEnergy. During my time there I worked with Java, Angular, Azure Devops, AWS Cloud Services, MSSQLServer, and SQLServer Reporting Services.
 I'm currently looking for my next software role while working in implementations for a local FinTech firm.

I enjoy solving data problems and UI design.

I'm also in the process of developing a dockerized full stack MERN application for displaying information on the sport of Formula 1
 
 ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting started in open source contributions. Starting up has been kind of intimidating, but I'll take any pointers and beginner issues.
